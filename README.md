## Usage

### Help page

In command line:
```shell
Usage: predict_CIRPMC.R [options]

Options:
        -i CHARACTER, --infile=CHARACTER
                Path of X input file

        -o CHARACTER, --outfile=CHARACTER
                Path of Y output file

                Show this help message and exit
```

### Quick start
The following code runs an example of CIRPMC.

```shell
predict_CIRPMC.R -i test_X.csv -o pred_Y.csv
```

## File format

### Input file


Input file is a csv file, stores the measurements of 23 markers for each patient:
* BUN	
* SpO2	
* RR	
* No. comorbidities	
* D-Dimer	
* Age	
* Hypertention	
* LDH	
* APTT	
* WBC	
* LBC	
* PT	
* UA	
* Consciousness	
* Hb	
* ALB	
* Diabetes	
* Coronary heart disease	
* PLT	
* CRP	
* Sputum	
* TB	
* PCT
 

### Output file
Out file is a csv file, stores the predicted results from MRPMC:
* LR: The predicted critical illness probablity from logistic regression
* SVM: The predicted critical illness probablity from supported vector machine
* RF: The predicted critical illness probablity from random forest
* GBDT: The predicted critical illness probablity from gradient boosted decision tree
* NN: The predicted critical illness probablity from neural network
* Probability: The predicted critical illness probablity from our ensemble model CIRPMC
* Cluster: The predicted critical illness status, 0 or 1.
* Risk group: The stratified risk group, Non-critical or Critical.
